        <h3>For the first category I used Equal Count (Quartile). This category puts the counties into equal amounts so one category won't have more counties than another. This data set is good for showing an equal representation between groups. However, the downsides are its not equal length between each group so the data can be seen as skewed.</h3>

        <h3>For this category I used Equal Interval. This category puts each group into an equal range from starting to end point. The positive of this category is it shows the accurate data and the discrepancies between different counties. The cons to this are most counties are going to be on the low end of the spectrum due to some counties having such a high population.</h3>

        <h3>For this category I used Natural Breaks (Jenks). This category normally puts the group into clusters and the areas around normally represent each other. The positive is it shows it more as an area instead one county being lit up. The con is its not equally represented and most of the counties are overshadowed.</h3>
